Google's TensorFlow Fashion Classifier (Tutorial)[https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification]

This little baby model is so smart, I'm so proud of it.

`model.py` defines the model, checkpoint path and class names
`train.py` trains the model and saves the weights to the checkpoint path
`trained.py` loads the checkpoint weights and does some fun stuff!
